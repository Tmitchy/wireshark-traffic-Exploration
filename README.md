# 🕵️‍♂️ Unveiling the Secrets of Network Traffic with Wireshark: A Hands-On Project Journey!

🔍 **Welcome to my packet analysis project!**  
This repository showcases my practical exploration into the world of **network traffic analysis** using the industry-standard tool: **Wireshark**. Whether you're a fellow cybersecurity student, a networking enthusiast, or just curious—this project highlights how packets tell stories of what's happening under the hood of the internet.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Wireshark is one of the most powerful tools for examining what’s going on in your network at a microscopic level. In this hands-on project, I practiced:

- Capturing real-time network traffic 🌐
- Applying filters to isolate specific protocols 🔎
- Analyzing packet structures at multiple layers 📦
- Identifying signs of unusual or malicious behavior 🧠

## 🛠️ Tool Used: Wireshark

🧰 **Wireshark** is a **network protocol analyzer** used to capture and examine packets traveling through a network. Here's what it allows you to do:

- 📡 Select an active network interface (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc.)
- ▶️ Start capturing live network traffic
- 🧬 Apply display filters to narrow down analysis (e.g., `http`, `tcp.port == 80`, `ip.addr == 192.168.1.1`)
- 🪄 Inspect individual packets across layers:
  - Ethernet
  - IP
  - TCP/UDP
  - Application-level protocols (HTTP, DNS, FTP, etc.)

## 🎯 What I Learned

This project has taught me critical foundational skills in cybersecurity and network engineering:

- ✅ How data flows across a network and how protocols interact  
- 🔍 How to filter and follow conversations between devices  
- 🕳️ How to detect anomalies like:
  - Malicious payloads  
  - Port scans  
  - Unusual IP traffic patterns  
- 🛠️ Real-world usage of Wireshark for:
  - Network troubleshooting  
  - Intrusion detection  
  - Protocol reverse engineering
