# wireshark-traffic-Exploration
Python-based TCP port scanner for learning basic network enumeration techniques

Tool: Wireshark

Wireshark is a powerful network protocol analyzer used to capture and examine data packets traveling across a network. To use Wireshark, you start by selecting the network interface (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet) and then begin capturing live traffic. Filters can be applied to focus on specific protocols (like HTTP, DNS, TCP) or IP addresses for easier analysis.

Once captured, each packet can be inspected in detailâ€”Wireshark breaks down the data into layers such as Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP, and application-level protocols. This allows users to identify issues like delays, packet loss, unauthorized connections, or even signs of an attack.



Using Wireshark taught me how data moves through a network and how different protocols interact. I learned to apply display filters, track communication between hosts, identify suspicious behavior (e.g., malware or scans), and understand packet structures. It's an essential tool for network troubleshooting, cybersecurity analysis, and understanding real-time data flows.
